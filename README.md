# python-geometry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bengolder/python-geometry.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bengolder/python-geometry)

---------


A 2d and 3d geometry library in Python.

Next steps for this library:

* complete unit test coverage
* adding a polyline class
* adding a polygon class
* adding geometry algorithms, including

    * nearest neighbors
    * segment intersections
    * triangulation

* adding a quaternion class
* adding visual unit tests 
* adding mesh classes
* adding bezier and nurbs curves
